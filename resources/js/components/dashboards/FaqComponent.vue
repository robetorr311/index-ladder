The economical impact of current COVID19 global pandemic, made businesses, trade
and commerce more challenging, by impacting supply and demand equation, social
distancing, realistic probability of monetary crisis and uncertainty in value of currencies
and commodities.</p>
        <p align="justify">We are trying to provide the society with tools to be able to CONDUCT transactions in
terms of good and services, along with currencies. We encourage BARTER, for the
following reasons:</p>
        <p align="justify"><span class="color-title">1. Holds values when trading in goods.</span></p>
        <p align="justify">Lets say a barter trade is conduced between two parties, swapping cars, or houses, or
combination of both, as long as both parties agree on the associated values, they are
capable to making a TRADE, with both commodities holding their values. (A car or
house will intrinsically hold its attributes)</p>
        <p align="justify"><span class="color-title">2. Make a TRADE possible</span></p>
        <p align="justify">Trade is nothing but exchange of goods and services. Lack of money shouldn’t stop an
individual, a group of people or an organization from doing trade. Barter provide that
option, especially when there is no money involved, goods and services can still be
exchanged.</p>
        <p align="justify">Any difference in values of exchanging entities can be paid in additional good,
services or MONEY if the parties agree.</p>
        <p align="justify"><span class="color-title">3. Open more options for trade, besides goods, such as
services</span></p>
        <p align="justify">While encouraging trade in the form of barter, our platform does not prohibit its users
from using currency (digital/non-digital), commodity or service exchanges to make
trade possible, upon mutually agreed terms by the participating parties.</p>
        <p align="justify"><span class="color-title">4. Not bound by scarcity of money in individual possession</span></p>
        <p align="justify">Regardless of the reason such as pandemic, war, famine or other economic constraint,
scarcity of money usually effects the buying power of the individuals. One of the
features of our platform is to encourage people in getting the necessities of life without
money in their possession, by exchanging goods, new or used, provide services and
making trade possible.</p>
        <p align="justify"><span class="color-title">5. Help you establish a meaningful business relation</span></p>
        <p align="justify">While, exchanging goods and services, in comparation to digitally paying online or in a
store, both participating parties enjoy a more relatable and meaningful business
relation that is useful to expending their base.</p>
        <p align="justify"><span class="color-title">6. Protection again Monetary devaluation.</span></p>
        <p align="justify">Money represents buying power, and devaluation of money is common phenomena in
today’s economies. Trading in goods or services without involvement of money can
better preserve an individual’s buying power simply by either getting the possession of
the commodities or accomplishing a task done as a result of service (such as, an
electrician fixing your home lightening system in exchange for a used TV screen)</p>

          <p align="justify">There are three fundamental attributes for an entity to qualify as Money.</p>
<p align="justify"><span class="color-title">1. Storage of Value</span></p>
<p align="justify">Money must be able to hold the value to be effectively use for trading. The faster
its losses its ability to store the value, less attractive it will become.</p>
<p align="justify"><span class="color-title">2. Measure of Value or Unit of account</span></p>
<p align="justify">Money must be able to provide a standard of value or a unit of account against
which the value of commodities can be measured.</p>
<p align="justify"><span class="color-title">3. Medium of Exchange (of the Value)</span></p>
<p align="justify">Money must be able to have the ability to be accepted as a medium of
exchange. The medium of exchange varies with time, but as long it can
effectively deliver its stored value, it will serve its intended function. Acceptance of
money very much rely on its ability as a universal mean.</p>

price of the item or service I am trading?</h3>

      <div id="collapseeigth" class="collapse" data-parent="#accordion">
        <div class="card-body">
          <p align="justify">A simple way to put the value is to define the purpose or functionality associated with
the commodity over a period of time. E.g.</p>
          <p align="justify">A new car (Model X, price = 10 units ($, £, ¥, €), warranty 10 years to be functional)</p>
          <p align="justify">A used car (Model X, price = 07 units ($, £, ¥, €), warranty 07 years to be functional)</p>
          <p align="justify">A definition of value can be challenging when it come to used goods or items, but it
doesn’t stop a person in possessions of the item to be traded. Get an opinion from third
party, ask others in the forums, ask the other trading party, what value they see in the
items, that made them interested in trade, and how would they like to value it.</p>
          <p align="justify">For services, usually a market survey (locally or globally) can give you an idea about its
value, and again ask others in the forums and the interested party.
Key: As long as both parties agree upon the value, with clear understanding of the
trading entities, they can do an exchange or trade!!</p>
