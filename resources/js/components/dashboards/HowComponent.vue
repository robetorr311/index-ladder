            <p>A mutually agreed upon exchange of tangible or non-tangible entities whose values
are clearly defined and understood by both parties.
The outcome of trade is an occurrence of the exchange of the values associated with those
entities. If an entity preserves its value, it can be traded. In other words, if an entity holds its value
for an hour only and then become worthless or ZERO essentially, means it can be used for
exchange just for an hour while it has its “value</p>

            <p>In reality there is no such thing as “Perfect Money”, but hypothetically, it

impervious to time, global boundaries and always accepted. What would be risk factor
associated with PERFECT MONEY whose value preserve itself indefinitely. Why Gold, or precious
metals, are consider safe havens when it come to securing one’s assets?
Preservation of Value is number one key element that should work in the interest of an individual.</p>
